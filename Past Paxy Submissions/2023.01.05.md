# 2: Explore job opportunities and report back what was seen, and mention what the requirements were (outside of having a bachelors degree, listing experience is okay)
# > on indeed, 930 jobs, requirements for 1 listing : "automated software test development1yr", "embedded realtime software applications 1yr", another : "experience at CMMI, capability maturity model integration"," fluent in linux" many times i saw SQL, "PLM evironment, 3d CAD"

# 3: Make a Github (which makes a Git) account to view current progress and what has been done (In the future we will use this link to submit assignments)
# > i have a github account but im going to make a git account aswell
# > https://github.com/paxyam

# 4: Install a text or code editor for your program of choice and explore it, become more intimate with it (this text or code editor is called IDE)

# 7: Google "what programs(or games)was written in [your language]" and just look at the code and try to abstract what and why it was written the way that it was

# 8: State a end of year goal, and pin it, this is your end goal, if you cannot think of one then an option you can make is 'make a racist sudoku solver'
