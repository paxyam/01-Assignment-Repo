# 1: Discover what language you want to learn first
# > Language C
# 2: Explore job opportunities and report back what was seen, and mention what the requirements were (outside of having a bachelors degree, listing experience is okay)
# > on indeed, 930 jobs, requirements for 1 listing : "automated software test development1yr", "embedded realtime software applications 1yr", another : "experience at CMMI, capability maturity model integration"," fluent in linux" many times i saw SQL, "PLM evironment, 3d CAD"
# 3: Make a Github (which makes a Git) account to view current progress and what has been done (In the future we will use this link to submit assignments)
# > i have a github account but im going to make a git account aswell

# 8: State a end of year goal, and pin it, this is your end goal, if you cannot think of one then an option you can make is 'make a racist sudoku solver'
