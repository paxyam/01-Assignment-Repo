***
## To submit: copy this post, and add in the relevant information under each objective, some questions are free hand, other questions are very clear. in order to submit program assignments, take a screenshot and post and pin it on discord.

# Goals: 
### 1: Discover what language you want to learn first

### 2: Explore job opportunities and report back what was seen, and mention what the requirements were *(outside of having a bachelors degree, listing experience is okay)*

### 3:Make a Git *(or Github)* account to view current progress and what has been done *(In the future we will use this link to submit assignments)*

### 4: Install a text or code editor for your program of choice and explore it, become more intimate with it *(this text or code editor is called IDE)*

### 5: Watch at least 3 videos and link what videos you watched, prefer videos on "how to start ..." "5 best reasons you should be learning ..." "how my mother was able to make 100k sitting on the couch coding"

### 6: Explore books or information on how to begin programming your language
##### *(it is advisable to buy a 1 (one) book on the program you are learning) consider downloading "Human Resource Machine" this will give you a more computer science approach to learn how to program, after which "7 Billion Humans."*

### 7: Google "what programs *(or games)* was written in *[your language]* and just look at the code and try to abstract what and why it was written the way that it was

### 8: State a end of year goal, and pin it, this is your end goal, if you cannot think of one then an option you can make is 'make a racist sudoku solver

### 9: Make a "Hello World!" program

### 10: Make a table of fahrenheit and centigrade, the initial  should start at `40 fahrenheit,` then go up `20 fahrenheit increments,` stopping at `320 fahrenheit.`
For Example

|40|4|
|60|15|
|80|26|
|100|37|

### It doesnt need to label first column as fahrenheit, or second column as celsius, what matters most is the calculation, to figure out celsius the equation is 
(Fahrenheit - 32) * (5 / 9)

### Can also be written as: 

(Fahrenheit - 32) * 0.555
