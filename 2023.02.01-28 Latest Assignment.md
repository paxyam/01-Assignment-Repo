What you enter will be "i/" as in "in"
What comes out will be "o/" as in "out"

1: make a program that takes any user input and outputs the same input
i/<what you enter> <yes>
o/ yes

2: make a program that will take user input and enter it into a sentence
how old are you?
i/ < 28 >
o/ you are 28 years old

3: make a program that will out put the recipe for cookies when you type in <Cookies>

4: make a program that subtracts whole integers within the program
(inside the program it should read : 9 - 6 = 3)
o/ 3

5: make a program that subtracts decimalled numbers within the program
(inside the program will read : 6.1 - 0.2 = 5.9)
o/ 5.9 (with no 0's in front or behind)

6: make a program that will truncate to the first 5 digits of pi
(3.1415926535897 use these digits)
o/ 3.14159

7: make a program that will take any number you put in and subtract it by 25, needs to be able to output negative numbers
i/ <20>
o/ -5
i/ <30>
o/ 5

8: make a program that will calcute every increment of 20 centigrade to fahrenheit starting from 0, ending at 100 centigrade
(the formula is [(1.8*C)+32])
o/ 0    32
o/ 20   68
o/ 40   104
o/ 60   140
o/ 80   176
o/ 100  212
